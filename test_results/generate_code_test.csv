Increased Awareness,"And I've noticed myself when I'm under stress, when I'm having a hard day, I feel shaky and then I eat something and then I feel better and somehow that's where the interest came from: ""Okay, what's actually going on with my blood sugar?"""
Stress Impact,"Then I also experienced relatively quickly that when I work in the emergency department and am stressed, even if I have eaten a lot, I have very low blood sugar levels, i.e. too low."
Food Influence,"And it was very interesting to see the effect that stress or mental strain or physical strain has on this. Whereas physical stress wasn't so much in the foreground, because when I went for walks, it was still well balanced, so to see that the body can control it really well. And also to get a feeling for which foods have which influence, for example a very balanced meal with lots of protein actually caused a relatively stable curve and you felt very good, whereas a very carbohydrate-rich meal with almost exclusively carbohydrates caused big peaks."
Underestimation Risk,"And that's where I perhaps see the limits of the whole thing, that you might underestimate the problems of people with diabetes if they have these values."
Empathy Development,"So that's what struck me.  GA: You have the feeling that your consciousness has changed a bit in this direction? Can you say that?  TN6: Exactly. Or that's where I see the danger in tracking yourself and then seeing: ""Ah, I'm still doing well,"" for example."
Sensor Limitations,"And that's where I perhaps see the limits of the whole thing, that you might underestimate the problems of people with diabetes if they have these values."
Improved Understanding,"And that made me realize that I need to eat even more to somehow compensate for this.  At the same time, I also noticed that when I'm at home or on a quiet shift on the ward, for example, everything is actually relatively balanced."
Patient Perspective,"And then also to see what patients are confronted with when I already have a supposedly healthy salivary gland. Ehm, problems that could result from this for me now are that, for example, I have seen very low blood values, I was already stressed on the emergency ward, but that is not a dangerous situation for me."
Stigma Reduction,"And that they simply no longer have this stigma and don't just say: ""I have to step away from life for a moment to do this"". Instead, the sensor just keeps running, so to speak."
Increased Awareness,"And that's where I perhaps see the limits of the whole thing, that you might underestimate the problems of people with diabetes if they have these values. So that's what struck me."
Stress Impact,"I was surprised by the results. Of course I expected that there would be fluctuations, but I didn't think that my stressful everyday life would bring me, i.e. my blood sugar, to my knees like that."
Individual Variation,"So it's like that again, like I said before, it's like a comparison. So you have the feeling, why is it now up with her and not with me, so that you somehow... yes, so that you just... that it's mega individual you notice even more through that, I think."
Time Commitment,"And then I had to set an alarm clock at the weekend so that I wouldn't forget, because otherwise... (Surprised noises from the other participants) Yes, but I can imagine that it's a challenge for patients to have the whole time management and the whole thing in their heads."
Sensor Discomfort,"But in the shower, when you get into the shower in the morning and you're so stressed out, I'm like ""Wow!"", so I've been a bit too roughly short. Or even when you're sleeping, you can still feel it a bit if you're lying on it the wrong way, so it bothers you a bit and I don't think you're aware of it beforehand."
Increased Empathy,"Then I imagine what it was like in the past, when you didn't even have a Freestyle Libre and then you had to prick your finger all the time. So I was a bit bothered by those eight hours, but then with the: ""Yes, what was it like in the past when you had to look for the device, prick your finger and hold on to it like that."" That's a lot more effort, and you don't even realize beforehand how much effort it takes to simply have diabetes."
Glucose Fluctuations,"And ehm, that even on a balanced day there are still curves that are still within the normal range, but are still relatively pronounced. Ehm... yes, even though I'm supposedly so healthy."
Food Impact,"I've always tried taking apple cider vinegar to control when I've had some high sugar and that has an effect. Or running a bit after carbohydrates with a meal, and that also had an effect."
Increased Awareness,"Well, I just think that dealing with the subject of blood glucose yourself naturally heightens your awareness of what are normal blood glucose values and what are not, and of course when I see someone's diary I can also think my way back into the curve that I saw on the Freestyle Libre and then draw my conclusions. Is the person doing well or not?"
Improved Understanding,"And one thing I can perhaps add is that there is another thing that we have also described, which is simply to see exactly which diet influences blood sugar and how. So to see that on the basis of a curve and also certain lifestyle decisions and stress and the job, you can see that much more clearly on the basis of several values and not just points. And I think it's very valuable to adjust a little bit and see that you have a more balanced blood sugar level."
Empathy for Patients,"I think I'm honestly much more interested in it now. So before, blood sugar was always something like: ""Oh, now the person also has diabetes, now I have to cover that somehow."" And you were always happy if the person had a good regimen that worked well, then you might have injected a bit more as the disease progressed, but then it worked. And to be honest, when patients came in who... where it was always exacerbated, you were a bit like: ""Oh, now you have to take care of it"
Visualizing Glucose Curve,"I think that's an advantage when you see the information in a curve, not in discrete data points. Because afterwards you always have to do that and ehm, you forget this curve. You just see this number and ehm, health is like a curve and you have to integrate so many factors and you see that with this device that it shows a... not just a point, that's a story."
Sensor as Status Symbol,"In America there's a waiting list for this um, app called Levels. And Levels measures the blood sugar curve and says, ""Oh, you have inflammation from these high levels."" And everybody's waiting for Levels and they buy it and it's like a status symbol that you think about it."
Reduced Stigma,"And uhm, before, people see the sensor and they say ""Oh, they have type 1 diabetes."" And in the US people are wearing it more and more for this reason to just know the curve, to know the inflammation. So, it's not a sign of your diabetes, it's actually a sign of ""I'm a very health conscious, very health literate person."" For me, that was interesting."
Convenience and Comfort,"The advantage, at least as I perceived it, is of course the wearing comfort. It holds firmly, it's somehow weatherproof, water-resistant, you don't have to restrict yourself too much, you can even go to the sauna. So first of all, as far as the sensor is concerned, you can do everything you need during the day."
Improved Patient Management,"And the other advantage for patients is of course that your diabetologist has a much better overview of what your values are. Otherwise you can somehow say: ""Yes, everything's fine."" And of course, you always have the HbA1c, but still, with a device, just like she (TN2) said, the new one always measures and the pumps always measure. And you also have the nice curves where you can see exactly how an individual responds to how much insulin, so you have the chance to achieve much better long-term sugar with a device."
Increased Awareness,"Well, I just think that dealing with the subject of blood glucose yourself naturally heightens your awareness of what are normal blood glucose values and what are not, and of course when I see someone's diary I can also think my way back into the curve that I saw on the Freestyle Libre and then draw my conclusions. Is the person doing well or not?"
Empathy for Patients,"And that's why I just think to myself: ""Yes, I totally understand that diabetics... I mean, that a disease like this somehow takes up so much of their lives."""
Understanding Fluctuations,"And if you think, okay, what would such a curve look like in a patient with diabetes, you can probably imagine that the fluctuations are greater than they were in your case."
Psychological Burden,"And, I'm sorry to put it like this, but it must also be a psychological burden, depending on how resilient you are / because I think it's just a huge burden for many people, and it's like, you're confronted with this illness all the time and you're confronted with the fact that your values are shit all the time."
Individualized Care,That means you have to work individually... to see with the patient what his needs and wishes are and what he is prepared to participate in?
Patient Responsibility,"And even on their own, the doctors are also confronted with the fact that they have to realize that they can't get all patients well adjusted if the patient himself doesn't work in the team and isn't there. Because he probably does the main work and we are only there as coaches and whatever to support him."
Sensor for Athletes,And I also think that athletes might be interested to know when they are running their ultramarathon when they need to eat something in order to have the perfect level. That might also make sense.
Risk of Hypochondria,So I think that the risk of developing a kind of hypochondriac with your blood sugar is too high and also because it might not necessarily have a benefit for you.
Obsession Potential,"I don't think I would recommend it to the average person who doesn't have any pre-existing conditions, because they just don't understand it. And I think you can get obsessed very quickly and I can imagine people who have a tendency towards orthorexia and eating disorders that it could have a negative impact."
Increased Awareness,"And I think that somehow shows that you don't feel any of your sugar at all. And if you have type 1, and you just know how dangerous it is, depending on how much you inject, because they usually inject more than type 2 or. So I think that's..."
Direct Connection,"Then I could say directly: ""Ah, I used to have that too."" And then you have a direct connection to the patient, that's also what's fun about treating patients, when you can create a connection that goes beyond talking about how ill this person is or what you need to do now. So I'm always happy when you have something that connects you."
Empathy for Patients,"I think if I were a patient who was now confronted with a metabolic disease, i.e. a new diagnosis, and the doctor said to me: ""I can understand you or you can understand me, I've already worn the device"", then I think I would feel a bit stupid. Because somehow, you may have worn the device, but you don't have the disease, so that's another two fundamental differences."
Glucose Fluctuation,"Or even after eating, we've also had sugar spikes a few times, after eating spaghetti, we didn't feel any of it at all, we were just a bit shocked. and I think that somehow shows that you don't feel any of your sugar at all."
Improved Understanding,"And I think somehow that's really cool with the sensor on the one hand, but you're constantly dealing with the sugar"
Limited Connection,"Sure, it's great in itself that someone can tell you first -hand what it felt like with the device, but the connection you share is very limited."
Patient Perspective,"So you also think that it's well received from the patient's perspective when treating physicians can say: ""I've tried this too."" Or when you talk about a device, if you can say: ""I've had that experience too?"" Do you see this more positively from the patient's perspective or does it not play such a role because they have an idea of the content without self -experience (i.e. the doctors)?"
Self-Experimentation,"I mean, we did the self -experiment with ourselves as doctors and if we say that it has helped us, it would of course be a suggestion that other people try it out when treating such patients."
Understanding of Diabetes,"I think the main challenge is that diabetes is a disease that affects many people and is often asymptomatic at the beginning. That you simply have, firstly, or good screening programs to filter out or catch those who have it at an early stage. And, of course, good treatment, where the main aim is to prevent or avoid all complications."
Increased Awareness,"And I think somehow that's really cool with the sensor on the one hand, but you're constantly dealing with the sugar. Even with type 1, where you don't have to increase the dose overall, but you do have to increase the interval or...it's a big challenge or."
Food & Sugar Focus,"And ehm, in the past we probably didn't have the sensor, always there with the pricking, I imagine that's te rrible, isn't it? Ehm and with, you actually have to be an expert on food, on food, just when you go to a restaurant, you don't know what other hidden sugars are in there, when you cook yourself you know, ""okay, you can have so and so much""."
Glucose Fluctuation,"So I'm very, well, I wondered very much how well you find out in these two weeks with the sensor, how well you get a feel for it. Because I have to say, it depends on a lot of different things how your blood sugar is, especially how hungry you are and how quickly you eat. That's what I noticed above all."
Eating Disorder Risk,"And ehm, I was particularly interested, I don't know who from this group attended this training yesterday from the eating disorder specialist. She said that type ones and type twos, especially teens, ehm, have a high risk of developing an eating disor der if they have been diagnosed with diabetes 1 young."
Patient Perspective,"So the challenges and restrictions that I have had, they probably have to put up with them too. And then I thought to myself, I have to carry this for two weeks, others have to carry it for a lifetime. Unless there are further developments, which wil l certainly be the case. But of course that's not something fun. It's not something you do voluntarily for a long time."
Sensor Visibility,"And I was approached a lot, found it really interesting and somehow explained it and, and most of them were like ah, yes, they'd already seen it, right. And most of them have heard about it or something. So actually it was still an interesting thing, but if you're a patient and then you have to explain to everyone why you have it now and that you have diabetes and so on, or."
Sensor Normalization,"And then I did a lot of reading about the sensor. There's a movement now for normal people without diabetes to wear them to lose weight, w hich I can totally understand. Because you can, so at the beginning it was almost like an addiction for me or, then you do it all the time, or and then: ""Ah, great"" and so or, or somehow: ""Ah, now if I just eat the little salad, it stays mega in that range ."" And somehow I also think it's being pushed in the media now, or if you go and look somehow, or, maybe there's a change, that maybe everyone will be walking around with it at some point or."
Increased Awareness,"And then I did a lot of reading about the sensor. There's a movement now for normal people without diabetes to wear them to lose weight, w hich I can totally understand. Because you can, so at the beginning it was almost like an addiction for me or, then you do it all the time, or and then: ""Ah, great"" and so or, or somehow: ""Ah, now if I just eat the little salad, it stays mega in that range ."" And somehow I also think it's being pushed in the media now, or if you go and look somehow, or, maybe there's a change, that maybe everyone will be walking around with it at some point or. Like everyone is somehow taking the pill to lose weight and so o n, or, but so far it hasn't actually been something that I've seen in public."
Unexpected Peaks,"But otherwise there were really two or three episodes where there was a second peak after two or three hours, which I couldn't explain exactly, even though I hadn't actually eaten anything. And ehm, it was probably somehow a change in gastric emptying or something."
Alarm Fatigue,"We call it alarm fatigue. This m eans that alarms can be used with the sensor. That means low alarms and high alarms, and if the patient is constantly disturbed by alarms, he doesn't do anything, but gets tired of alarms. You have to set alarms that really make sense, that you're not unne cessarily disturbed every day, that you set certain times. Because it's like a hammer, if we need a hammer but we don't need it, then it hurts us. But if we need it unnecessarily, it's also useless."
Hypoglycemia Risk,"And then the alarm actually went off. And that's when I realized that it might be getting to that point again. But the problem with hypos is that you don't notice it for so long and then suddenly you're in it. And I also find that, well, it happens so quickly and it can then go in the wrong direction if you don't eat something and from that point of view, well, the alarm has already brought me something there, that I knew: ""Okay, now I'm just low again, now I should eat something again or not just, I don't know , run somewhere or something."""
Glucose Fluctuation,"And I was like, so... well, it makes sense, but I was amazed that it went up at first and then afterwards you fell much lower. And then I alway s have this feeling, you often have this feeling during exercise: ""Wow, now I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy."" But your blood sugar was actually higher afterwards than before you started exercising."
Patient Education,"Do you see an advantage of education, th at is, the patient gets the information: ""Look, this is a tool that can do this and this and this, but it also has a downside."" The patient receives the information and of course tries to use it sensibly and not overuse it."
Sensor Limitations,"That's a real limitation. But I think it goes a bit into the same discussion with the Journal Club with Ozempic or whatever, so you have to critically question whether it's clever. So I also found it really exciting for two weeks, but I can also imagine, as you (TN7) say, it t riggers something in you. Like: ""Hmm, yes, now I might want to keep it low. Now I'd rather eat a salad."" And especially for people who are even more susceptible to this, who probably want to track themselves like this, it can somehow result in an eating di sorder or whatever. So I think it's a fundamental question of how much unnecessary testing you want to do. There's no indication now for a... for me at 27 that I need a glucose sensor if I'm otherwise healthy."
Personalized Insights,"And that's what Levels means, let's see. There's a long waiting period, by the way , because this Levels is also similar to a sensor, but it also provides information based on previous values of blood sugar with food, so that it comes like a message: ""Last time with this food the blood sugar rose so much, is it still such a good idea to eat biscuits now, or could it be something else."""
Glucose Fluctuation Awareness,"And I was like, so... well, it makes sense, but I was amazed that it went up at first and then afterwards you fell much lower. And then I always have this feeling, you often have this feeling during exercise: ""Wow, now I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy."" But your blood sugar was actually higher afterwards than before you started exercising."
Sleep Impact on Glucose,"And that's just, just, I... it was so much more jagged there than during the week where I had a regular routine."
Hunger as Trigger,"And I think that's simply because I was hungry and the stomach just pushed it on directly. And then it just rises faster. So I had the feeling that hunger was the trigger, that it increased extremely quickly."
Individualized Approach Needed,So I think you really have to look at it more individually or take a lot more factors into account. I think that is certainly extremely important.
Fixed Schemes Ineffective,Not good. So because it's quite unpredictable...
Patient Understanding Crucial,"But I think if someone is intellectual, so there are a lot of people who are very concerned with the body and everything, then it works great. But it doesn't work for someone who somehow thinks ""diabetes..."" and who somehow doesn't have the same understanding. And I think you have to differentiate between the two, don't you?"
Lifestyle Modification Emphasis,"Because our experience is when we just blindly give them a sensor and say: ""Eat the way you always eat and just observe how your blood sugar levels are and report back to us after two weeks when we evaluate them."" So don't evaluate, don't judge, but say: ""Interesting, what experiences have you had?"" And patients come up with ideas: ""Yes, I've seen that grapes aren't good. I've seen that I need to eat differently in future."" These are like aha moments that the patients themselves report."
Sensor Use for Non-Insulin Dependent,"But in the case of non-insulin-dependent diabetics who simply need to be adjusted nutritively, for example, or a little with Fomin, is there a sensor that you can give them to see what it does?"
Patient Forgetfulness,"But that's so nice or that we also forget. Even if we get good instructions, it can be forgotten because other things come up in life"
Increased Understanding,"I think people are perhaps a bit more understanding of this, but I think it tends to be patients who are a bit unsatisfactory for me. Because you're like, ah, you've already said so much, you have to look well and then they still don't look and then you see a lot of reports from you about the consultation and then somehow they still don't do it. I don't think that has really changed anything or. More so maybe not even with our patients, but for me, especially younger ones, who I would see now, where you understand a bit more what that means, yes. But more just in relation to the application of the freestyle and not necessarily in general."
Empathy for Patients,"I do have the feeling that it has changed something a bit. Well, but I generally have the feeling that everything I've experienced myself, including my operations with my knee problems and so on, has changed me a lot. That I can understand patients better and that has now been a virtual situation again, where I felt like a diabetes patient. And I already have the feeling that it has changed something. Not that I understand everything or anything, but that it's such an important part and that you always have to measure and think about what you're injecting and so on. That these are actually poor patients, so that sounds a bit stupid with the ""poor"" or, but it's not just that you can swallow a pill for a heart attack or an aspirin and then it's good, or."
Improved Communication,"I think another important point is what I wanted to say earlier. If you wear a sensor like this yourself and then talk in such a way that the patient naturally understands... Well, they realize that you've had this before, so you just talk differently. That also has an incredible effect on the patient. So I see it on the ward round, sometimes when I talk about my spondylodesis, I suddenly grab patients because they know that I've been through it too and so on. And I can imagine exactly the same thing happening when the diabetic realizes: ""Hey, we've had this experience too, we know it."" And it's not just something theoretical, then you can somehow get together as a team and perhaps make a plan. And that could have a positive effect."
Real-World Application,And I'm not sure whether that's the bigger burden for patients.
Lifestyle Modification,"And there, I have to say, I see the advantages above all that they no longer have to inject themselves all the time, or have to measure their blood sugar all the time by taking blood samples. With type 2, I have to be honest and say that it's perhaps a bit of deformation professionnel, I find it really tedious at times. Because quite honestly or, it would probably be possible to avoid a lot of these problems with a lot of lifestyle modification. And people are just comfortable and... I don't think I'm sure whether wearing a sensor like that, that's my personal opinion, without injecting insulin, would help that much. Or, because they tell themselves all the time that they know what they're eating isn't good, or if they see sugar now, I'm not sure if that will change their behavior that much."
Glucose Fluctuation Awareness,"And I've already thought about that, so how could I have calculated that correctly? Yes, because it just never... didn't always do what I expected. So how can you really anticipate that you're going to make the right splash?"
Sensor as a Tool,"From your point of view, you could also go back, how would I potentially approach my patient differently now, treat them differently? And in the ideal world, how can I use the sensor to develop an understanding of the disease and, above all, to develop an understanding of the patient? Do I see a benefit from the sensor or do I see no benefit, i.e. it is not a permanent sensor, but a one-off experience?"
Post-Injection Regimen,"And what is your perception of the post-injection regimen now? When patients with diabetes we always prescribe this post-injection regimen, which means that you only inject bonus insulin when the blood sugar levels are high. And if someone already has diabetes, has this somehow changed their memory as to whether the post-injection regimen has any benefit at all for diabetes patients or should they not rather cover their food properly before eating? Or is it difficult?"
Increased Awareness,"And with me as a non-diabetic, you're somehow still a bit inhibited about going to someone to be pricked and to take measurements and everything somehow anyway. It's normal for those who don't know any different. And I actually thought it was great when it happened so quickly. I never knew exactly how reliable it really was."
Data Volume Impact,"How ehm, what you can probably do now with the several values that you have, somehow, how relevant to therapy it really is now. That also surprised me a bit, because there are simply a lot more values and a lot more data and a progression that you probably didn't have before. So you didn't see a daily profile like this."
Patient Perspective Shift,"But wouldn't that be exactly the feeling you've all had now: ""No, I don't want to show it!"" Does that help you to understand how a patient might feel when they have to go to the doctor with their values, which really aren't like that?"
Doctor-Patient Trust,"And that's why the doctor's first investment is really trust, trust, trust. And then probably just give a little hint as to whether they might consider changing."
Patient Pressure Impact,"Certain patients either do the opposite when you put pressure on them, but certain patients need pressure. They say: ""I can't discipline myself otherwise, if you don't give me pressure, then I won't change anything."""
Glucose Management Complexity,"Because it's always a balancing act, either they're too high or they're too low, they're not always in the green zone all the time. And we don't expect that either, we only expect 70% in the green range, 30% in the... so of 30%, 5% in the lower range and 25% in the higher range. But this is also a repetitive process."
Psychological Impact,"So it's psycho-diabetology. Diabetes is not a disease of glucose, it is a disease of the interaction of glucose with the person. And that's why the psychological aspects are so enormously important."
Long-Term Trust Building,"So that's also an important point that we often forget, that it takes an incredibly long time until the patient has confidence or. And I'll come back to my own example, but I think... Moritz, my son, also has psychological counseling and I often think somehow, what are they discussing and it's not about.... They don't even look at the problems?"
Increased Awareness,"I found it pretty exciting and easy. I also had the problem that I had the sensor on for one day and then it stopped working. That's why I came back and I didn't understand why it suddenly stopped working. And I have to be honest and say that I forgot about the sensor for two weeks. Because it's just so inconspicuous. Then when I was showering I was sometimes so afraid that it would come off, but in principle it didn't bother me at all over the two weeks. I was actually only ever afraid that it would come off again."
Unexpected Fluctuations,"I was surprised, especially early in the morning before I got up, I had quite a few hypoglycaemic episodes. Somehow I fell to three each time and I hadn't expected to fall so low. I've always, I don't know, some people say they can feel it a bit when they're hypoglycaemic, but somehow I've never had it in the morning. And yet the sensor showed me several times that my blood sugar was a bit low. I wouldn't have expected that, especially in the morning when you still have the cortisol release and everything. That I would get so low."
Increased Understanding,"I just noticed, for example, when I was jogging and hadn't eaten for a really long time and then got so shaky, I could track that in the curve. I found that really exciting."
Lifestyle Impact,"And I then somehow drew the conclusion that I might have to adjust my lifestyle a little. From that point of view, it might be good, but it also stressed me out a bit. So I did a lot of looking, but after jogging, especially in the morning, after eating, then somehow in the afternoon at work, so I measured a lot."
Patient Empathy,"I still find it difficult to conclude from the blood glucose measurement, which doesn't have a direct consequence for us, whether I would be very non-compliant if I had diabetes. I think I would measure it differently if I knew: ""Okay, I have to inject now and I need to know what the sugar is."" Then I have the feeling that I would be more conscientious. I think it's certainly possible to forget and everything, but I have the feeling that there's a big difference. Because now it's a bit, certainly a bit interesting to observe and everything, but ehm, if I forget, it's not so bad and everything, exactly."
Stressful Experience,"And what also worried me a lot was that in stressful situations, you could really see how my blood sugar rose. Somehow I couldn't really stop that, because seeing it was even worse. And then I always had to try to forget about it and just have the sensor. And then it usually just normalized again, but... yes, well, not so... I didn't find the study so relaxing because it just stressed me out a bit that the values were so borderline..."
Food Sensitivity,"Gummy bears, whooop! (Gestures with his index finger straight up towards the ceiling) Through the ceiling.  (All laugh)  TN12: That's really bad.  TN9: I didn't expect it to be so extreme, so much more than chocolate or something. So there were also differences in the chocolate, not every chocolate rose to the same extent. (laughs)"
Increased Compliance,"I think I would measure it differently if I knew: ""Okay, I have to inject now and I need to know what the sugar is."" Then I have the feeling that I would be more conscientious."
Increased Awareness,"I think, yes, it simply requires that you look at the figures and think about them. And I think that's something important or. If you're not aware of it or you're not conscious of it, then you're not going to pay that much attention to it."
Visual Understanding,"I know, just visualizing it for two weeks so that you can really just see how it is could also be helpful. And that you can see the direct impact. And you can really see it, it's not just a number, you can see the curve."
Improved Patient Empathy,"I generally have the feeling that if you have some kind of connection to yourself in the lectures, then you are somehow always a bit more attentive. From that point of view, if you had somehow dealt with it beforehand, you probably would have."
Enhanced Glucose Knowledge,"And also these figures with blood sugar levels, what's normal, what's not normal"
Personalized Learning,"And then you can say: ""I'm going to do more sport or something else this week and then see what the curve looks like."" So I think that's a huge advantage that you can... I think it's necessary or that you write down the blood sugar in your tables and everything in your diabetes books, but somehow an overview for the patient, I don't know how he has that. It's just a huge collection of numbers and of course if there's a nice curve or something, it's much easier to see what the effect of these measures has been."
Increased Attention,"I think diabetes is such an important topic, so if it simply passes a medical student or any other student by, then that's not good. So I think that almost everyone is aware of that, or that you have to deal with it and I don't know how much additional benefit it brings. I think maybe you can do it better, so maybe you're already more attentive and everything, but it's a question of time until you're faced with a problem where you have a patient who has diabetes and then you have to take a closer look at it again and make your own considerations."
Improved Understanding,"Well, I think it would have... When I think about how I went to the lecture, when I went, it would have helped a lot. Because you... diabetes is a really important topic, but I think especially as a medical student, when you're so overwhelmed with all the options and can't really prioritize what to do...."
Increased Awareness,"I think I've benefited a lot from a sensor like this, simply because it arouses my interest more. So learning by seeing, doing, hands on. Rather than just the theory, but more as a gimmick and an interest."
Improved Understanding,"I think it's certainly getting easier. So I have the feeling with the technology, you can see that at any time with the numbers. But I clearly see this simply as an intermediate step until you simply have a fully automatic insulin pump afterwards and that is the next step, that you don't actually have to do this anymore or that it automatically measures and applies insulin or. That's simply the intermediate step that we have now or and I think that simplifies it."
Patient Perspective,"Would this tool also help to understand the patient's perspective? That you feel like you're doing an intervention that diabetes patients potentially have to do with themselves and I've gotten to know this intervention a bit and I can put myself in the shoes of the patients, how would they feel?"
Blood Sugar Fluctuation,"Well, it's always been clear to me that blood sugar is something that fluctuates extremely, especially now with diabetics. And that it's simply a slight reference value and ehm, we noticed that immediately, as soon as you've eaten something, the value... You can... You know something's wrong, you have to look at it very critically, the values you have there."
Sensor Pressure,"I think that the possibility that you have because of the sensor, that you can always read it out quite easily, can probably also put you under a bit of pressure. That you should actually have it so well under control, because after all, you can track it."
Time Constraint,"And, TN11, you briefly mentioned earlier that, firstly, we don't have enough time in the inpatient setting for patients to receive in-depth diabetes care and they also have separate appointments for this."
Glucose Monitoring Pain,"And I was also surprised how little it hurt... well, it didn't actually hurt at all, like getting it in. It's..."
Blood Sugar Factors,"Yes, sport, sleep, I have the feeling.  
TN12: Stress.  
TN11: Yes, stress..."
Motivational Interest,"So: ""What happens when you have eaten a Vermicelles?""  
TN11: So...  
TN9: Yes, I still find it exciting that you have a bit of an idea. But it's more a question of interest, I mean, in the end it doesn't really matter if it's always measured anyway."
Increased Understanding,"I think... you can still read about a lot of things, but it's always, I still find it extremely fascinating how my body simply reacts and how you can admire how well it somehow works for you."
Improved Empathy,"I always think it's good, self-awareness, I always think it's good. It simply promotes empathy, always."
Body Awareness,"I think... you can still read about a lot of things, but it's always, I still find it extremely fascinating how my body simply reacts and how you can admire how well it somehow works for you."
Glucose Fluctuation,"Yes, just how quickly the body reacts, especially to food, how quickly the sugar goes up but then comes down again. It's logical, actually, but I think it's different when you look at it like that."
Forgetfulness,"I think for me it's the point that I've already said, to have this understanding for patients who somehow don't measure so consistently all the time. Because I don't know now how I would have measured if it had had a consequence, then I would probably have done it differently. But just that in general, yes, you can understand much better that people forget this in everyday life."
Patient Perspective,"I think for me it's the point that I've already said, to have this understanding for patients who somehow don't measure so consistently all the time. Because I don't know now how I would have measured if it had had a consequence, then I would probably have done it differently. But just that in general, yes, you can understand much better that people forget this in everyday life."
Non-Compliance,"I could show the patient a lot more understanding that he doesn't measure that often and that it just slipped his mind. I think that's my main point, which I think I draw from the fact that you can really just forget about it."
Stigma Reduction,"Yes, exactly! That you're not immediately stigmatized or anything."
Trust Importance,"It's always big, no matter what specialty."
Continuous Care,"Yes, I think it's particularly important with a chronic illness like diabetes, where a lot of checks and so on are necessary. Much more so than with other problems and long-term care is somehow the most sensible."
Increased Awareness,"And I found it exciting, ehm, I had in particular... I wasn't aware that my blood sugar always tends  towards hypoglycemia an hour after eating. And that also correlated well with the feeling of hunger that I sometimes have an hour after I've eaten something. That surprised me and I have now been able to document that this is indeed the case."
Improved Understanding,"And then I also found it interesting to see what effect my eating behavior has in the sense that, for example, if I don't eat anything at work and then eat a sandwich for the first time at 2 p.m., that's really bad for my constant blood sugar level. That messes everyt hing up, as if I really eat a lot and regularly during the day, it doesn't make much difference to my blood sugar at all."
Personal Experience,"I didn't really notice it anymore. It was always pointed out to me because my children tried to tear one off. But I actually found it pleasant. And I found it exciting, ehm, I had in particular... I wasn't aware that my blood sugar always tends  towards hypoglycemia an hour after eating."
Empathy for Patients,"And I think it's really useful  for people like that. Then I've also heard about diet and healthy lifestyle applications, that different diets are practiced depending on glucose levels. I think I've also seen a few books that have come out, but I haven't read them."
Glucose Fluctuation,And that also correlated well with the feeling of hunger that I sometimes have an hour after I've eaten something. That surprised me and I have now been able to document that this is indeed the case.
Dietary Impact,"And then I also found it interesting to see what effect my eating behavior has in the sense that, for example, if I don't eat anything at work and then eat a sandwich for the first time at 2 p.m., that's really bad for my constant blood sugar level."
Alcohol Impact,"And the other thing is that I very rarely drink alcohol, but I once drank alcohol one evening and then there was an immediate spike, s o that was impressive."
Sensor Discomfort,"It did hurt a bit for me, but I think it's just that a needle bent and that's why it no longer worked. But because the needle was somehow at an angle, I could feel it."
Increased Awareness,"And I've also been approached by lots of people: ""What's that? Why do you have this now?"" I also... I was still impressed, people are like that, it's been like that, some people are like hmmm, don't know exactly and don't ask and others actively approach it and suddenly it becomes a  topic of discussion."
Visible Illness,What I found very interesting is that diabetes is actually an invisible disease and this sensor makes it visible.
Fluctuation Observation,And then it was exciting to see how they fluctuate and how they are over the course of the day.
Glucose Spike Triggers,"For example, I once ate grapes as a snack and then I saw that my blood sugar levels had become very, very high, more so than with chocolate or other sweets, for example."
Exercise Impact,"I've also found it very interesting, for me too, as soon as I've exercised or done sport, my blood sugar levels have risen and then fallen."
Stress Impact,"And ehm, I also noticed that I often woke up at night, for example, because I hadn't slept well, so my sugar levels were higher. So I don't know whether that's ultimately due to the stress hormones."
Sensor Limitations,"I noticed that the sensor didn't stick so well, so I stuck it on with a plaster at the end."
Patient Comparison,And then it was also exciting to see that it rises much faster and is much higher and more constant. But it was just exciting to be next to each other and compare.
Uncertainty & Stress,"The sensor was a bit stressful for me, I have to say. It's not the first time I've worn the sensor, I don't have diabetes, but I had it in my settings that I had to be alerted to threshold values on both sides."
Hypoglycemia Alarm,"And the same evening that I got the sensor and I drove home, I got an alarm, hypoglycemia, and then I kind of yes, then I eat something, then I ate something."
Physiological Understanding,"Yes, so with fever the body simply needs more, that it works more. And then I've also read that insulin resistance... that it needs more insulin. Exactly."
Patient Perspective,"And if you put yourself in the patient's shoes, a patient will probably not only get hypo alarms but also hyper alarms. What could be working in this patient, this technology?"
Fear of Hypoglycemia,I think there are a lot of people who have hypoglycaemia all the time and maybe don't feel it so well anymore and are very afraid of it.
Increased Awareness,"So I knew it wasn't constant. But I've become more aware of how much it varies. So it's not from three to five. But whether it's 4.9 or 5.6, you can't rely on it in any way."
Fluctuating Glucose,"In my case, there were a lot of different values at night, but then you explained that it could also be a measurement error. But I was surprised, I actually thought that the blood glucose value would be more stable in the seam and mine was mega fluctuating, even at night. But apparently it really can be a measurement error."
Improved Empathy,"And I think many people still have a bit of the old image that you always have to get pricked, which many people also find unpleasant. Especially in this respect. And I think it's mainly in this respect that you give the patient this tool and that they can come to terms with it better themselves and it's then more of an empowerment of the patient."
Patient Empowerment,And I think it's mainly in this respect that you give the patient this tool and that they can come to terms with it better themselves and it's then more of an empowerment of the patient.
Lifestyle Impact,"I'd just been to the emergency and had a very unhealthy diet. And afterwards I ate gummy bears and then I thought: ""Oh, now it's going to go up."" And then it didn't rise at all and then I thought: ""Ah, well then..."" (all laugh) GA: So there are gummy bears inside? TN15: Exactly. Not organ juice, I noticed that it had just gone up. No, I actually had a pretty constant progression. I was never too high or too low. And that's why I made a bit of the same observations as you two (TN13 and TN25) with the feeling of hunger, that it was pretty consistent. Then, I have the feeling that it also gives you a sense of trust in your body, that you can rely on your body to look a bit like: ""Hey, maybe you should eat something now."" And then you do that and then it's already well adjusted."
Technology Dependence,"I just realized that you're really dependent on your cell phone with it, of course. Otherwise you're already super dependent. I actually wanted to go two days without a cell phone, and then I realized: ""Oh no, I have to scan."" So it's also mega, it's like something..."
Patient-Centered Care,"I think that the patient is very important. Especially if you want to prevent the long-term effect. If you have a young patient with type 1, then I think it's more important than if you're giving insulin to old patients, where you can do it via a pump, where they simply don't have to worry about it. Then it's also an option. But that's not the aim, actually with young people you'd rather want them to have this awareness and adapt to the fact that they can also track long-term damage, because it's a disease that doesn't... that lasts for years. That's why I think it's important to train them well and motivate patients to really be involved."
Prediabetes Management,"I think it also offers great potential for people with prediabetes. You can virtually save yourself all the medication, all the illness, if you perhaps observe your own body a little and somehow try different diets, interventions and exercise. And ehm maybe you can avoid so much suffering from diabetes. Because I think quite a lot of people have prediabetes and you can achieve a lot by changing your lifestyle."
Improved Understanding,"I think it gives you a certain security to be able to say afterwards how to apply it and everything. How it changes, because you have seen it yourself, maybe you can also understand the fears when there is an alarm now is hypo or now is hyper. I think that's good for understanding and for the safety of the patient."
Patient Empathy,"I think it also gives a good insight into how the patient feels. We've now been in patients' shoes practically every two weeks. We have observed ourselves and developed different tendencies. I think there is quite a lot of understanding of how fluctuating the value can be, what it does psychologically with different people. And so for me personally, it's been quite useful."
Data Collection Hype,"I think it's certainly super cool, but I also think there's a certain amount of hype, health hype, about regulating everything precisely. And that many more athletes are now always measuring their glucose. I think it can make sense for races or something like that, so I have a lot of athletes in my environment, including professional athletes, who have also done this, but somewhere along the line it stops with data collection about your own body, so I think that's when you don't have to. Because in the end, yes, it is, but how often do we really adapt to it afterwards?"
Self-Observation Interest,"And also simply now, when you're somehow working on the emergency figures, it's so irregular how you eat. You have to somehow make sure that you eat enough and not eat nothing for twelve hours and just see how your body copes with it. And then also to see that even when it drops, it always rises again without me having eaten anything. So it's enormous self-regulation that takes place. And I thought that before, well, I thought that, but I was really interested in what it's really like and that's why I thought I wanted to do it simply out of an interest in self-observation in the end, yes."
Peer Comparison,"But I also... one part was that we were all there and could say: ""How's your curve, show me, do you also have these values?"" So we also compared them with each other a bit or I compared them with the friend with diabetes and I think that if you don't have it at all and you're on your own, you can see it, but you don't have anything to compare it with. So maybe that too, you don't have... There's like a lot of diabetes and hypoglycemia, but there's not so much information when healthy people simply have sugar levels, which is normal. That's why I think it was also important to be able to say to someone else: ""Hey, do you also have hypoglycaemia at night?"" And so that you can also talk to each other a bit, I think that was also part of it."
Personal Motivation,"Somehow I've also seen people walking around with it and I thought, I kind of want to do that too. Simply because I was so amazed at what it's like and afterwards I was like: ""Oh, I must have diabetes or..."" I also think it's important to know where you stand yourself. Yes."
Limited Exclusion,"Exactly, it's not a means of exclusion, but I just wanted to feel a bit safe."
Cost-Benefit Consideration,"That's why I think it's more for those who are more interested and then of course it's always a cost-benefit consideration as to whether it wouldn't make sense later. And otherwise generally giving the population something additional that they can actually worry about, I have the feeling that that would be a bit problematic for the healthcare system at some point."
Increased Awareness,"I think the spectrum is a bit difficult to say. Because I was really motivated to measure, but what I noticed is that after two weeks, just within two weeks, I didn't show as much interest at the end as I did at the beginning. Simply that I no longer  measure it as often and am no longer as surprised when it goes down or up."
Improved Understanding,"And then exactly. So I still h ave this here... because if you're just on your own and only do it for yourself, then afterwards you only know about yourself and nobody else. That's why I think if you really want to use it as training, you have to do it somehow so that you can really exc hange ideas afterwards."
Self-Discipline,"It simply takes a lot of self -discipline. So that you always measure it and always check it, even if it's an automatic pump, but also if there weren't automatic pumps and you had to enter how much correction was needed. It takes so much self -discipline and I think it's impressive, it really impresses me."
Fluctuation Awareness,"And I thought th at before, well, I thought that, but I was really interested in what it's really like and that's why I thought I wanted to do it simply out of an interest in self-observation in the end, yes."
Patient Perspective,"And you now only have the experience of your own glucose regulation with effort, where it is associated with the sensor you have dealt with."
Technology Impact,"Yes, the technology is changing faster than we are changing as people. Each of you probably has a spectrum of patients, or that's a diabetes patient who understands therapy well and is very motivated, engaged and other spectrum is, the patient doesn't even want to know about the disease and doesn't want to have any influence."
Control & Management,"But at the same time they could obviously manage it well and that probably gives a certain feeling of control over your own life, control over the illness, that you have the feeling that you are healthy again, t hat you have your life under control again."
Daily Routine Impact,"And above all, it's not somehow limited in time, but then it's decades. And to be honest, I thought it would be easier. I always thought: ""Ah, now there's this great technology with the sensor, it's really  easy."" But it still takes a lot of discipline, even if it's just stalling and then reacting, but still."
Group Discussion Value,"I think if you do it like this as part of a study or in such a way that you sit together afterwards and discuss and perhaps compare, so that you don't just see your own, but see that it's different for everyone. I found it really interesting that it' s different for everyone."
Increased Understanding,"And I have to say that after this experience, I now have more understanding that it's difficult and requires a lot of self -discipline and th at it's not so easy to do."
Improved Empathy,"And I had the feeling: ""Yes, it's not that difficult to keep the blood sugar under control."" And I have to say that after this experience, I now have more understanding that it's difficult and requires a lot of self -discipline and th at it's not so easy to do."
Patient-Doctor Partnership,"Can you see yourself as more of a partner if you have worn a sensor like this and as a doctor you go to the patient and develop the feeling: ""Okay, in the end the patient manages the diabetes themselves."""
Glucose Fluctuation Expectations,"In other words, you expected your blood sugar to fluctuate more, but you were disappointed that it was actually more stable"
Sensor Limitations,"But somehow I don't see that you can only do that with blood sugar. And that's perhaps why I went in with the wrong expectations and learned a bit from that, or that blood sugar itself isn't the only parameter you can use to find out when you're hungry and really need food."
Stress Hormone Impact,"And then my blood sugar always rises, which actually makes sense afterwards. Stress hormones go up or you do sport, b lood sugar is delivered into the blood, so to speak."
Continuous Monitoring Value,"Yes, and she was in a hypo beforehand. So and then you just, you just know it without first... so we measured capillary again anyway, but... ...yes, exactly. It's just a good indication of that. Yes."
Real-World Application,"But on a normal day, for example, I get up, I don't actually eat anything and then I cycle there, which is quite intense for forty minutes. And then my blood sugar always rises, which actually makes sense afterwards."
Technological Advancements,"Monitoring has simply become a bit different, hasn't it? You can now measure blood glucose almost continuously, you have pumps, you can actually replace basal insulin with a base that is injected continuously."
Unexpected Stability,"And that's perhaps why I went in with the wrong expectations and learned a bit from that, or that blood sugar itself isn't the only parameter you can use to find out when you're hungry and really need food. Or ehm, yes, that you just don't realize that you burn a lot through exercise."
Hunger vs. Hypoglycemia,"And I actually had the same experience. That there was very rarely a correlation with, for example, eating and then it rises. So I also had the feeling, yes, that's exactly what I had, that hunger pangs are not hypoglycemia at all. I could imagine that for a patient with diabetes this is also crucial to know, is this hypo or not hypo? Because that's the only way I've noticed that you can't assess it at all, because you can't feel it at all. You have zero feeling for what the sugar is doing, that was my surprise, that you have zero feeling for it."
Alcohol Impact,"Yes, you do notice... Well, in my case I simply noticed when you drink alcohol, so a beer or something and then maybe risotto. There are certain things where I've noticed that it's gone up, especially when you drink alcohol with food."
Sensor Acceptance,"Well, I have to say I found the challenges very small and I think you get used to them quickly. You don't have to think about it so much because it actually works automatically."
Improved Patient Care,"Well, I think it was a really good experience for me to wear it. I mean, before I would never have thought of recommending it to a patient and now I would do it, I have to be honest. Yes."
Empathy for Patients,"And could it also be that the patient feels better if the patient thinks: ""Okay, the doctor has his own experience, even though he doesn't have diabetes, has dealt with it a bit and knows how it works""? Could that also help?"
Increased Interest,"Yes, I think so. Especially with the endocrinologists, we've also had a bit of a conversation with them, so I've also sat in a conversation where they've shown a patient the device and explained a bit about how it works and so on. and then try it out for yourself, then you can really say: ""It's like this and this. And for me it was like this and this."" You also know what you're really giving the patient, because it's easy to test and I think it's very instructive."
Real-World Learning,"I think it would increase interest in learning about diabetes besides just frontal lectures, that everyone gets a sensor and learns how their own glucose behaves, would it bring something, would it increase interest?"
Increased Awareness,"I think it was a really good experience for me to wear it. I mean, before I would never have thought of recommending it to a patient and now I would do it, I have to be honest. Yes."
Patient Empathy,"And could it also be that the patient feels better if the patient thinks: ""Okay, the doctor has his own experience, even though he doesn't have diabetes, has dealt with it a bit and knows how it works""? Could that also help?"
Limited Value for Healthy Individuals,"Well, as a general rule, I find it rather problematic. So you can try it out, I think that's actually okay for everyone, but it's actually a joke if I just keep doing it. It just wouldn't help me with anything, it's just resource-intensive and this constant measuring is just not..., so not particularly useful for anything."
Potential for Obsession,"Or it can help you to choose the right path. So it's both, it can be stressful, but it can also be helpful. It depends on what kind of patient we have wearing it. Do you have any thoughts on this?"
Limited Insight into Diabetes Management,"So I think specifically for wearing the sensor yes, but all the rest no. It's just a very small part of it where you get an insight."
Value for Prediabetes,"And maybe if someone has prediabetes and then constantly has slightly higher values and then maybe they notice, I don't know if it's like that, but if they then go for a run for maybe half an hour or go cycling, that the values go down a bit and that if they eat more, they go up again. Maybe that could have a positive influence, but maybe more that he's seen it, or."
Confirmation of Regulation,"I now have the impression that you have received a bit of confirmation that the regulation is working well for you. That it calms you down a bit, almost in that sense."
Potential for Misinterpretation,"I think it's more likely that you could imagine what would happen if it went up, i.e. above or below the bar. I could already imagine what it would be like if it were higher. I just think it's always like that, when you do it with students, you discover a few more diabetes. So it's always like that, if you do an ECG on everyone, you always discover something."
Increased Awareness of Patient Challenges,"Did you feel addressed, did anyone ask you why you have a sensor on now? Other participants were constantly being asked by people: ""Have you got diabetes now, or?"""
Increased Understanding,"What I appreciated about the sensor study was the ability to analyze the body's reaction to subtle influencing factors to blood sugar regulation: sleep, stress, exercising before or after eating, emotional regulation."
Improved Awareness,Wearing a glucose sensor for two weeks was an exciting experience that revealed problems previously unknown to me in diabetes patients.
Sensor Limitations,"Even though the traceability of one's own blood glucose values is indeed simple and quite comprehensive, I was surprised by the sensor's susceptibility to errors ('hypoglycemia' at night with muscle compression), as well as the 'vulnerability' of the sensor in everyday situations such as drying off after showering or sitting on a bench."
Empathy for Patients,I found the experiment very exciting as I have often wondered how high my blood sugar is and how my diet affects it.
Sensor Discomfort,"Unfortunately, my sensor failed after just one week after I reacted to the adhesive. It was very itchy, so I was almost glad when it fell out."
Privacy Concerns,I did not like that people saw the sensor and were 'judging' if I were diabetic. It is not a silent disease anymore and sometimes we need privacy and discretion with our medical diseases.
Self-Monitoring Trend,"Nowadays, we monitor ourselves around the clock and, above all, with our watches: wearables everywhere. The self-measurement of people has become an attribute of modernity or perhaps also a symbol of maintaining the illusion in an increasingly insecure world that we can do something, that we can control ourselves."
Blood Sugar Consistency,You can learn a lot with such a sensor in your arm. First of all: how constant blood sugar is in healthy people. My values were practically always within the normal range.
Subjective Blood Sugar,I learned how little I subjectively feel the level of my blood sugar and how quickly and with what delay changes in blood sugar can be measured.
Sensor Stigma,"I'm sure people around me thought the same. A sensor on the arm is a stigma. Some saw the sensor or watched me download the results and looked pityingly. ""Oh, poor Ludwig, he's got it now too... He has diabetes..."""
Increased Understanding,"Compared to diabetes patients, this has significantly increased my understanding of the mechanisms of continuous self-monitoring."
Sensor Ease of Use,"I was amazed at the consistency of the regulation and how easy, painless and unproblematic it is to use a sensor."
Blood Sugar Fluctuation,"I noticed how little the feeling of low blood sugar correlates with hunger. The idea that ""I am hypoglycemic"" is only true to a very limited extent."
Blood Sugar After Eating,I found it impressive to observe my blood sugar for the first time after eating a pizza over lunch. It shot up from under 6 to almost 9 mmol/l. But I didn't really feel anything from this either.
Unexpected Learning,"An unexpected learning point: on October 23, at the beginning of the second measurement, I had also eaten very little during the day and in the evening I went to Heilbronn in Germany to give a lecture."
GLP-1 Impact,"Apparently the liver was unable to adequately utilize the many calories, or the combination with the GLP -1 led to a rather low blood sugar, below the threshold."
