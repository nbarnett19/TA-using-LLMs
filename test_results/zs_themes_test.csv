Enhanced Understanding of Self-Regulation and Body Awareness,Participants reported an increased awareness of their own bodies and a greater understanding of the complex mechanisms of self-regulation.,Renewed Interest in Self-Observation,"Participants expressed a renewed interest in self-observation, motivated by the insights gained from self-tracking.","And also simply now, when you're somehow working on the emergency figures, it's so irregular how you eat. You have to somehow make sure that you eat enough and not eat nothing for twelve hours and just see how your body copes with it. And then also to see that even when it drops, it always rises again without me having eaten anything. So it's enormous self-regulation that takes place. And I thought that before, well, I thought that, but I was really interested in what it's really like and that's why I thought I wanted to do it simply out of an interest in self-observation in the end, yes."

Whereas physical stress wasn't so much in the foreground, because when I went for walks, it was still well balanced, so to see that the body can control it really well. And also to get a feeling for which foods have which influence, for example a very balanced meal with lots of protein actually caused a relatively stable curve and you felt very good, whereas a very carbohydrate-rich meal with almost exclusively carbohydrates caused big peaks."

GA: You have the feeling that your consciousness has changed a bit in this direction? Can you say that?  TN6: Exactly. Or that's where I see the danger in tracking yourself and then seeing: ""Ah, I'm still doing well,"" for example."

Otherwise you can somehow say: ""Yes, everything's fine."" And of course, you always have the HbA1c, but still, with a device, just like she (TN2) said, the new one always measures and the pumps always measure. And you also have the nice curves where you can see exactly how an individual responds to how much insulin, so you have the chance to achieve much better long-term sugar with a device."

If you wear a sensor like this yourself and then talk in such a way that the patient naturally understands... Well, they realize that you've had this before, so you just talk differently. That also has an incredible effect on the patient. So I see it on the ward round, sometimes when I talk about my spondylodesis, I suddenly grab patients because they know that I've been through it too and so on. And I can imagine exactly the same thing happening when the diabetic realizes: ""Hey, we've had this experience too, we know it."" And it's not just something theoretical, then you can somehow get together as a team and perhaps make a plan. And that could have a positive effect."

Emphasis on Patient-Centered Care,"Participants emphasized the importance of patient-centered care, recognizing the need for individualized approaches and patient empowerment.",Patient Responsibility and Self-Management,"Participants acknowledged the importance of patient responsibility in managing diabetes, emphasizing the need for patient engagement and self-management.","And even on their own, the doctors are also confronted with the fact that they have to realize that they can't get all patients well adjusted if the patient himself doesn't work in the team and isn't there. Because he probably does the main work and we are only there as coaches and whatever to support him."
Emphasis on Patient-Centered Care,"Participants emphasized the importance of patient-centered care, recognizing the need for individualized approaches and patient empowerment.",Prioritizing Patient Needs and Preferences,"Participants emphasized the importance of patient-centered care, prioritizing the patient's needs and preferences in all aspects of diabetes management.","I think that the patient is very important. Especially if you want to prevent the long-term effect. If you have a young patient with type 1, then I think it's more important than if you're giving insulin to old patients, where you can do it via a pump, where they simply don't have to worry about it. Then it's also an option. But that's not the aim, actually with young people you'd rather want them to have this awareness and adapt to the fact that they can also track long-term damage, because it's a disease that doesn't... that lasts for years. That's why I think it's important to train them well and motivate patients to really be involved."

And Levels measures the blood sugar curve and says, ""Oh, you have inflammation from these high levels."" And everybody's waiting for Levels and they buy it and it's like a status symbol that you think about it."

And I'll come back to my own example, but I think... Moritz, my son, also has psychological counseling and I often think somehow, what are they discussing and it's not about.... They don't even look at the problems?"

Instead, the sensor just keeps running, so to speak."
Impact on Visibility and Reducing Stigma,Participants discussed the impact of the sensor on the visibility of diabetes and the potential for reducing stigma associated with the condition.,Normalization of Sensors for Health Monitoring,"Participants observed a trend towards the normalization of sensors, with individuals without diabetes using them for weight management and health monitoring.","And then I did a lot of reading about the sensor. There's a movement now for normal people without diabetes to wear them to lose weight, which I can totally understand. Because you can, so at the beginning it was almost like an addiction for me or, then you do it all the time, or and then: ""Ah, great"" and so or, or somehow: ""Ah, now if I just eat the little salad, it stays mega in that range."" And somehow I also think it's being pushed in the media now, or if you go and look somehow, or, maybe there's a change, that maybe everyone will be walking around with it at some point or."

That also surprised me a bit, because there are simply a lot more values and a lot more data and a progression that you probably didn't have before. So you didn't see a daily profile like this."
Advancements in Diabetes Technology and its Impact,Participants discussed the rapid advancements in diabetes technology and their potential impact on patient care and self-management.,Potential for Increased Dependence on Technology,"Participants discussed the potential for increased dependence on technology for diabetes management, highlighting the need for careful consideration of its role in patient care.","I just realized that you're really dependent on your cell phone with it, of course. Otherwise you're already super dependent. I actually wanted to go two days without a cell phone, and then I realized: ""Oh no, I have to scan."" So it's also mega, it's like something..."

So I think that's a huge advantage that you can... I think it's necessary or that you write down the blood sugar in your tables and everything in your diabetes books, but somehow an overview for the patient, I don't know how he has that. It's just a huge collection of numbers and of course if there's a nice curve or something, it's much easier to see what the effect of these measures has been."
