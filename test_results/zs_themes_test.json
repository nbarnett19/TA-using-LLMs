Well, they realize that you've had this before, so you just talk differently. That also has an incredible effect on the patient. So I see it on the ward round, sometimes when I talk about my spondylodesis, I suddenly grab patients because they know that I've been through it too and so on. And I can imagine exactly the same thing happening when the diabetic realizes: \"Hey, we've had this experience too, we know it.\" And it's not just something theoretical, then you can somehow get together as a team and perhaps make a plan.

Then it's also an option. But that's not the aim, actually with young people you'd rather want them to have this awareness and adapt to the fact that they can also track long-term damage, because it's a disease that doesn't... that lasts for years.
